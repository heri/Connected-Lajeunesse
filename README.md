# Home Lajeunesse

Tablet app powering the mirror in Heri's house - with daily calendar, weather, github, tweets notifications, news etc.

An iPad or an Android tablet can be used as this is done with React. However, a low-cost tablet such as Amazon fire 7", a Nexus 2012 tablet is recommended :)

## Credits

Thanks to Kai Jin who generously donated an Android for the project!

Based on Hannah's home mirror project, redone with Facebook's React-Native instead of Java.

## Environment Configuration
Add your github token and twitter ids in each component file. Then build:

```
npm install -g react-native-cli
npm install
react-native run-android
```
